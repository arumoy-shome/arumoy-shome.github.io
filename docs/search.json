    "text": "Introduction\nHello everyone and thank you for being here.\nI am Arumoy. I am a PhD Candidate at the Software Engineering Research Group at TU Delft. I have the privilege of working with excellent researchers such as Luis and Arie (who are somewhere in the audience). And after 2 years, I have found my calling.\nIn this talk, I am going to present the current vision I have for my PhD. I hope to generate some interesting discussions and get some feedback along the way.\n\n\nImplicit expectations to explicit tests\nHopefully, I don’t need to convience you that testing is important. We are software engineers, attending a software engineering conference afterall.\nThere is a wonderful paper by Zhang et al. (2020) that summarises the existing literature on ML testing. However, what has been ignored—until now—is the role of visualisations and how we use visual tests in the earlier, more “data-centric” stages of the ML lifecycle.\n\nZhang, Jie M, Mark Harman, Lei Ma, and Yang Liu. 2020. “Machine Learning Testing: Survey, Landscapes and Horizons.” IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.\nVisualisations enable a rapid, exploratory form of analysis. Practitioners use “visual tests” to check for data properties. These visualisations tell a story. They are there for a reason. The expertise and domain knowledge is embedded within the visualisation.\nThis works really well when we are working on our laptop, on say an assignment. But visualisations do not scale well across organisation changes or when we want to move towards a large-scale production system. Visual tests tend to be left behind as latent expectations, rather than explicit failing tests. This research gap between moving from visual to analytical tests is where we wish to contribute.\nVisualisations become latent expectations rather than explicit tests. And this gap between going from latent visualisations to more analytical tests is exactly the research gap where we wish to contribute.\n\n\nThe hunt for data properties\nThe good news is that we have a rich source of data—jupyter notebooks. We are using a two-pronged approach. The first step—which I have been working on for the past month—is to collect these visualisations or data properties manually. We are exploring two sources of data, namely github and kaggle.\nOnce we have found a sufficient quantity of data properties, we will scale it to a larger subset. We are aware of two such datasets proposed by Quaranta, Calefato, and Lanubile (2021) and Pimentel et al. (2019) which contains notebooks from Kaggle and Github respectively.\n\nQuaranta, Luigi, Fabio Calefato, and Filippo Lanubile. 2021. “KGTorrent: A Dataset of Python Jupyter Notebooks from Kaggle.” In 2021 IEEE/ACM 18th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), 550–54. IEEE.\n\nPimentel, João Felipe, Leonardo Murta, Vanessa Braganholo, and Juliana Freire. 2019. “A Large-Scale Study about Quality and Reproducibility of Jupyter Notebooks.” In 2019 IEEE/ACM 16th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), 507–17. IEEE.\n\n\nNext steps and beyond\nOur immediate objective is to provide a format definition of “visual tests” along with examples of alternative analytical tests that can be used by the practitioners.\nOur ultimate research goal is to recommend such analytical tests automatically to the practitioner. Here it becomes a mining challenge which jupyter notebooks contain three sources of information: text, code and images.\nWe see several opportunities to collaborate with researchers working in other areas. Besides ML testing, I see implications in reproducibity and code quality of jupyter notebooks, explainable AI and HCI."

Presented my research direction, work done so far, challenges and next steps. Content was mostly similar to the talk below. \n\n\n\n\nTowards Understanding Machine Learning Testing in Practice\n\n\nMay 15, 2023\n\n\nPresentation for our poster titled Towards Understanding Machine Learning Testing in Practice which was published in CAIN 2023. \n\n\n\n\nData Validation with TFDV\n\n\nMay 16, 2022\n\n\nIn this lecture we will go over the basics of data validation. The first half of this lecture will be a talk on the fundamentals of data validation. We will answer what is data validation?, why should we validate our data? and how we can validate our data?. The second half of the lecture will be a hands-on tutorial on using Tensorflow Data Validation, instructions & code for which can be found on this github repo. \n\n\n\n\nData Smells in Public Datasets\n\n\nMay 4, 2022\n\n\nIn this talk I will present our recent paper titled Data Smells in Public Datasets which was published at the 1st International Conference on AI Engineering (CAIN) 2022. I will first present the problem we are trying to solve along with the contributions that we made. I will present the methodology which was followed along with the results obtained. I will present a select few smells which I personally find interesting & hope will generate some discussion. Finally, we will conclude the talk with some high level takeaways from our study along with the limitations & future directions of work. \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Preserving Deep Learning\n\n\nSep 7, 2021\n\n\nA talk on Privacy Preserving Deep Learning (PPDL) I gave to my research group. It was largly based on a literature review I did during my Msc. \n\n\n\n\nResearch Workflow in Plaintext\n\n\nJul 12, 2021\n\n\nIn this talk I will go over how we can use Emacs and org-mode to craft a research workflow. We will look at how we can leverage the power of Emacs and org-mode to capture, store, search and retrieve research data, all in plain text! The talk will touch upon how org-mode can be used as an environment for literate programming and reproducible research. I do not assume any prior knowledge of emacs or org-mode and I want this to be more of a discussion rather than a talk. Please ask me questions as I go along and share your thoughts, tips and techniques with others! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "I am a researcher at TU Delft, working towards my doctorate as part of the Software Engineering Research Group. My research interests lie at the intersection of Data Science, Software Engineering and Design. Here I am developing tools, techniques and best practises which allow us to build, test, deploy, scale and maintain modern software systems with Machine Learning (ML) components. While we must look to the micro to identify and understand a problem, I try to keep an eye towards the current era of big-data and large-scale ML as a long-term area of research. You can find a list of my publications here.\nI completed my Msc. in Computer Science from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Universiteit van Amsterdam in the Netherlands, specializing in Big Data Engineering. As part of my thesis, I conducted interdisciplinary research with Nikhef and The Netherlands eScience Center to improve the data processing pipeline of the KM3NeT Neutrino Telescope using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks.\nI obtained my Bachelor’s in The Applied Sciences from the University of Waterloo in Canada, specializing in System Design Engineering with an option in Entrepreneurship. Here, I learned to bring creative solutions to complex problems with multiple facets such as society, economics, environment and politics. I also learned how to nurture an idea at it’s inception, develop it using systems theory and successfully bring it to the market as a finished product.\nMy professional experience is two pronged. I have over 5 years of software development experience through professional web development positions at and small companies. I am also versed with driven, research oriented projects rooted in diverse topics such as Large Scale Data Engineering, Data Visualization and Artificial Intelligence.\nI enjoy sharing knowledge and having discussions and am always happy to engage with other publicly. Sometimes, I write about my day-to-day challenges as a software engineering, data scientist & researcher.\nAll materials (excluding links to external websites or third party products) on this website are open sourced under the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 3.0 license."
