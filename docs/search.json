    "text": "Here I outline a workflow which I have developed to handle the non-linear nature of scientific research. There are days when one reads several papers without making much sense of them. However, a single paper the next day can result in a clear picture of the domain. The workflow acknowledges the fact that there are many more failures rather than successes in research. However, a failure is still an outcome—and this is what helps us decide what to do next—so it should still be recorded.\nResearch workflows are highly personal. If you decide to adopt any or all ideas I present here, it may require some tweaking so that it works for you. Years of performing an extrinsic search for existing solutions was unfruitful. Instead, I simply started reading papers and let the process develop organically. Soon I noticed some common patterns and standardisation which allowed me to automate some aspects of the process.\nThere are 3 interdependent phases to this process described below.\n\nFinding papers\nI save the bibtex entry in a bib file (generally in the project root along with the other latex files). This is because the bibtex-mode in Emacs provides powerful search options, templates for adding entries, sorting entries, cleaning up, and much more. Besides, the bib files ultimately gets used in the report so it makes sense to group the two together and keep them in the same location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 2021-06-15 Tue\n\n\n\nI no longer save bibtex entry in a bib file. Instead, I store them with my notes in the same org file in source code blocks. I use org-tangle to generate the bib file when needed.\n\n\nFirst, I use good ol’ Google Scholar (along with a plugin to enable my institution’s proxy) to find papers. Once, I find a paper I open it and read the abstract. If the abstract appeals to my current research focus or is interesting to me in general, I download it and save it in a folder which syncs across my devices. Next, I grab the bibtex entry and create a task using org-capture where I save the bibtex entry, one liner on why I found the paper interesting. I add the location to the pdf on disk, I set the title of the task as the bibtex entry and I save it to my inbox (or relevant project org file).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 2021-06-15 Tue\n\n\n\nI have written an Elisp package that automates all of this. With the bibtex entry in my clipboard, I now issue an org-capture template which creates a new task with the bibkey as the header, adds relevant properties such as first author last author and source of publication, and sticks the bibtex entry in a source block (see aocp.el).\n\n\nIn scientific paper discovery I describe my process of finding relevant papers in more detail.\n\n\nReading papers\nI read the papers on my laptop. My screen is usually split 50-50 between Emacs (where I take notes) and a pdf viewer. I do not make any highlights because its easy to abuse and it ties the information to the pdf viewer application that I am using.\nInstead, I take notes in plain text (as of 2020, I have been using org-mode, an Emacs major mode to do so). There are several, rationales for doing this digitally. First, I require these notes to be searchable and link-able to other notes. Second, research projects often span for a long duration. Having digital notes ensures that I do not have notes distributed amongst several analog papers/journals. Lastly, I take notes on papers in a specific manner. These notes have a specific purpose - and thus a carefully constructed structure as described in the next section - and thus come under the category of hard information (I talk more about productivity and how I categorise information in productivity).\nI use the 3 pass technique as presented by S. Keshav in his paper titled “How to read a paper” (2007). I employ the first pass as a screening method to identify if a given paper is worth reading in full. During the first pass, I read the introduction and conclusion and briefly glance over the sections of the paper and the diagrams. The goal here is to determine the problem that the paper is trying to solve and get a preliminary idea of the proposed solution and results. Generally, I can determine all the above characteristics just by the reading the introduction and conclusion if the paper is well written.\nDuring the second pass, I read the results, discussion and limitation sections in full. During this phase I {edit, elaborate} my earlier notes made during first pass and also add my personal remarks pertaining to the paper. When reading scientific work in detail, it is often helpful to read at a macro and micro level. For instance, before reading a section from top to bottom - in a linear sense - I often find it helpful to first scan the sub-sections and draw a tree diagram of the topics. This allows me to have a visual representation of the section which often times is enough to quickly conduct a mental cost-benefit analysis of reading the section in detail.\nI rarely read a paper in it’s entirety. I think this is essential when you peer-review a paper (which I do not do yet as of [2021-06-30 Wed]) but unnecessary for day-to-day scientific work.\n\n\nWriting notes\nNotes on paper being read will always be in relation to the current research focus/goal. A paper may be read multiple times but will have different notes if they were made with reference to different research questions.\nFollowing this rationale, I store the notes in an org file pertaining to the project I am working on. I store the pdfs in a central location, synced with a cloud service provider so as to have offline access.\nAnd following are the aspects that I look out for when reading papers.\n+ problem statement :: What is the problem the paper is trying to\n  solve? Why is this problem important? Why should I care? This\n  generally leads to a good material for the introduction of my\n  paper as well.\n+ solution :: What is the solution the paper proposes? How is it\n  better compared to existing ones (do the authors try to show its\n  worth by comparing to existing solutions)? Why should I care about\n  it?\n+ results :: What were the analytical experiments conducted and what\n  were their results? What datasets were used? What models were used\n  and how did they perform? How was their performance evaluated?\n\n  Generally, in my field these questions can be answered by reading\n  the results section, very rarely are results disclosed in the\n  conclusion section. Note that falls out of the 'first pass' content\n  so I may come back to this only if I need this information for the\n  task at hand.\n+ limitations :: Does the paper identify its limitations? what\n  future work can be done?\n+ remarks :: My personal remarks on the paper. Was it well written? Is\n  it scientifically sound? Does it present a good overview of the\n  problem it is trying to solve? This critical examination and\n  cross-checking is essential when conducting a literature review.\nAfter writing down notes on the topics above, I try to write a one line summary of the paper along with my remarks. These are always guided by the research question or work at hand.\nThe “why should I care?” flavor questions will generally be guided by the research question or personal interest that I may have at the time of reading.\nIt’s worth elaborating on the writing process itself because this in itself is a highly non-linear and dynamic activity. With regards to my personal writing, I have noticed that the quantity and quality of notes are inversely proportional. In the early stages of a project, or when I am trying to familiarise myself with a new research topic, I tend to write more notes which are primitive (meaning they emphasise on the first principles) and are similar to the papers I am reading at that point in time. However, with exposure to more papers, the notes become more concise and opinionated (they reflect my thoughts and ideas on the matter).\nI also employ writing on paper and typing in an iterative, cyclic manner to formulate concise and clear text which express my discoveries, ideas and opinions.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "I think every project has 3 distinct components.\n\nKnowledge. Which may include notes, wikis, task lists, meeting notes, reviews, planning, etc.\nProduct. Which for me tends to be software, data, visualizations, etc.\nPublish. Which for research can be a paper or for product driven projects can be blog posts, company announcements, etc.\n\nThere are several tools for project management. The one that worked best for me was Basecamp and I have stolen many of their philosophies to craft my own.\nThe principles of managing a project is fairly simple. First, identify who are involved in the project, what you are going to do, how you are going to do it and by when you are going to do it.\n\nThe Who\nThe who become the stakeholders or clients of the project and need to be kept up to date on the progress, potential problems, approached for input, etc. Effective and clear communication is of utmost importance here.\n\n\nThe What\nThe what is the goal of the project. Some of the questions that we may ask are: What are we trying to solve? What is our research question? What are we building? etc.\n\n\nThe How\nThe how is the task list. Try to visualise the entire lifecycle of the project (to the best of your abilities given your current knowledge and technical capabilities) and write down the distinct phases of the project. Next, for each phase write down a list of tasks (and sub tasks). Keep a fluid mindset, projects change, clients want different things, research is dynamic. The idea is to start with a set of tasks and revise as and when necessary.\n\n\nThe When\nThe when is the date of completion. Deadlines are important for proper goal and expectation setting. It’s important to have a final deadline for the entire project, but also to have intermediate deadlines for smaller batches/mini-projects. Divide and conquer is the name of the game here.\nSome recommend a few weeks (4-6) for these batches/mini-projects. For research, I have found that taking things at a week-by-week basis works best and is the most flexible method of working given how dynamic research can be.\nFor each of these batches, I like to have a single focus of work. I then extract the relevant tasks that I should get done in order to accomplish the focus.\nDetermining focus is subjective and external factors such as other engagements play a role. The goal is to always plan sufficient work so as to not under deliver. I actively try not to plan too many things so as to feel overwhelmed or anxious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 2021-09-05\n\n\n\nSome notes on attaining focus can be found here.\n\n\nAt the end of each batch/cycle/week I conduct a review. I think about what went well (so things I was able to finish), what did not go well (problems, challenges, etc.) and what can be improved (mostly for personal reflection). During the review I triage the task list, revise project scope, deliverables, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can find more about my reviewing process here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Usually around late July - early August, I experience what I call “Productivity Anxiety”. It starts by me siting down in front of my laptop to work but not being able to identify what to work on. After an hour or so of contemplation, I start feeling guilty of not working. I know that if I can’t get myself to work on something I should get up and do something else. But then I would be missing out on work wouldn’t I? And so this vicious cycle continues over days, weeks, sometimes entire months.\nThe quickest way to get over this mental block is to work on something of importance, something with stakes where you have something to lose. Work projects are a good place to start. However that’s not enough. The other part is knowing what to work on, or what to focus our time and energy on.\nThe assumption here is that we have a functional task/information management system in place. This system allows us to collect all tasks in a centralised location which makes finding things to do next easier. Task management is not enough though, we must establish a notion of priority next. I find goals and project deadlines are a good place to start to derive some prioritisation of tasks/projects at a macro level (think year, quarter or month). For long running projects that stretch over several months or years (which is fairly common in research projects) I find setting pseudo-deadlines a great way to establish what to work on next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSee my prior post on productivity and research workflow for how I manage information.\n\n\nAlthough it’s easier to see progress over a longer period of time such as months or a year, we must approach work in smaller chunks such as over a few days or weeks. At this micro scale, I find assigning a theme per day helps minimise context switch, gain focus and stop wasting time trying to identify what to work on next. This theme can simply be a specific project or a group of similar tasks. For instance, I dedicate Mondays to writing and Fridays to reading papers. The rest of the days I break based on the current projects I am working on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSee project management for how I manage projects.\n\n\nTime blocking sounds like a wonderful productivity technique on paper, but in practise it does not work. First, it takes a lot of time to plan out work blocks every week. Second, I simply do not want to live my life based on what a piece of software tells me to do. Life is dynamic and time blocking does not accommodate emergencies or impromptu decisions. I don’t pre-plan work blocks. Instead, when I do find a block of uninterrupted time, I dedicate 100% of my energy to the task(s) at hand. I turn off all distractions and minimise breaks. Usually a 15 min stretch/coffee/bathroom break in the middle of a 3 hour block works well.\nThe overarching secret to the success of this system is the act of periodic review. The reviews help me adjust the priorities and tasks for the upcoming week/month/year. I also find tracking the time spent on the work blocks valuable. This paints a nice overview of how I spent my time during the last day/week/month and helps identify any “leaks” which need to be addressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNotes on my reviewing process can be found here.\n\n\nPerhaps the most important realisation I have had is that enjoying the free time, the mundane things such as cleaning and also doing absolutely nothing is equally important as working. Being in the moment and mindful when spending time away from the screen has made the single biggest difference in my work-life balance. Even though I have a constant hum of work to do, I am able to remain sane and produce a consistent, high quality of work by simply being present in the moment.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "In this article I describe my process for discovering relevant and important papers in a new scientific field. Since I am working towards a doctoral degree, I need to read a lot to develop a deep understanding of my field of research and stay current on the latest developments.\n\nWhere to Start\nThe starting point is always the most difficult. If possible, the best place to start is through recommendation from your peers/supervisor/advisor. If this is not possible, then coming up with a few good keywords from your research question is the next best approach. Reading a few non-scientific work (such as wikipedia) might be necessary to obtain the “buzz words” of technical jargon which are required to formulate the search queries.\nThe right way to familiarize oneself with a new field is through a systematic literature review. However, I find that to be too big a commitment for a new field of research (I may not stick with it if I don’t find it that interesting). So the smarter (and quicker way) to familiarize oneself with the literature is to read the related papers.\n\n\nFinding More Papers\nI categorise this search process into two parts: 1. Intrinsic and 2. Extrinsic.\nWe can find relevant papers from within the current paper we are reading. This can be done by first reading the related work section of the paper and second by reviewing the reference section of the paper. The related work section often leads to papers that are at a similar level of technical depth as the current paper. The papers in the reference section tend to be more general and provide a good high level overview of the field.\nWe can also find relevant papers from the search engine (Google Scholar in my case). The cited by feature of GS is a good place to find forward references or the papers which are citing the current paper. These tend to be more specific and bleeding edge as they came after the current paper. The related articles are also a good place to find similar bodies of work. Google Scholar and Connected Papers are good resources to explore this.\nUsually, 5-10 good, well reputed papers is sufficient to start with. And then, reading their related papers (and in turn their related papers, so on and so forth as necessary), should result in a collection of bibliography which paints a good picture of the field.\n\n\nStaying Current\nOne also needs to stay current on the field. For this, Google Scholar alerts are a good start. By now the “position papers” and important authors in the field should be known. Following these authors on Google Scholar and creating an alert for when a position paper gets cited is a good way to stay up to speed. Another approach is to keep an eye on the relevant conferences and find papers directly from there.\n\n\nConcluding Remarks and Acknowledgements\nI was surprised to find that not a lot of information on this matter is easily available. It is similar to how students are not taught how to learn effectively, before they start attending university classes. The emphasis on the “meta”, the methodology of doing something is lacking. I cannot take credit for the wisdom above, a lot of it came from conversations with my peers and Google Scholar help website.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "This document provides information regarding diet and nutrition. The premise is to identify underlying principles that determine optimal dietary requirements for weight loss and gain. For the prior goal, I am interested in nutrition which will provide optimal recovery and minimal muscle loss. For the later, I am interested in maximising muscle gain whilst minimising fat gain.\nNutrition is simply thermodynamics: Energy in must equal energy out for a system in equilibrium. If we consider that our body is the system, then the food we consume (energy in) must equal the energy required for our body to function (energy out). Logic thus dictates that when we eat less food than required, we lose weight and conversely, gain weight when we eat more.\nThe quantity of food/caloric intake required to maintain our bodyweight can be estimated from a TDEE calculator (easily available online, I have been using this one). From there, research has shown that a 10-20% increase/decrease in caloric intake will result in optimal weight gain/loss.\nEmphasis must also be put on the macro and micro nutrients. Specifically, research shows that 120gm of protein minimum results in optimal muscular recovery. Up to 160gm or 0.8/lb of bodyweight (whichever is larger) has been proven to result in optimal muscle gain when trying to gain weight. For the micro nutrients, it goes without saying, eat vegetables as much as possible! I personally also take vitamin D, omega-3 and multi-vitamin supplements. Vegetables also help me feel full longer.\nSome lessons I have learned from experience. Having a good diet is not a temporary setting and is precisely the reason why diets do not work. Having a good diet requires time, patience and a lot of experimentation to find out what works for the individual. Having a good diet is only the first part, having a good diet which is also sustainable is the key challenge (remember, you need to eat until you die). Finally, I think this requires a fair share of psychological strengthening. I noticed that for me, it took years until I found a good balance of food that works for me and learned to control my hunger/cravings.\nFollowing are some no-nonsense, community driven, public information that I keep coming back to time-and-time again. r/bodyweightfitness wiki contains links to valuable bodyweight fitness routines. The r/fitness wiki has several important pages. Specifically, the entries on weight/fat loss, muscle building and the FAQ page.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "After observing my workflow of managing bibliographic information in Emacs, I extracted the repeated actions into an Emacs package.\nTo gain some perspective on my workflow, see my prior article on my research workflow.\nThe package is available on github with two alternative installation methods: 1. By manually downloading the aocp.el file and sticking it in your Emacs load-path, or 2. Using straight.el which is what I recommend.\nThe package works under the assumption that you manage your bibliographic information in org-mode (a major-mode for Emacs). The functions made available through this package are intended to be used in an org-capture template, they are not meant to be called interactively (ie. by using M-x).\nAssuming that you have a bibtex entry in your kill-ring (either by killing text within Emacs or by coping text from an external application into your clipboard), this package will do the following:\n\nExtract the bibkey\nExtract the first author\nExtract the last author\nExtract the source of publication\n\n* TODO %(aocp--get-bibkey nil)\n  :PROPERTIES:\n  :PDF: file:~/Documents/papers/%(aocp--get-bibkey t).pdf\n  :FIRST_AUTHOR: %(aocp--get-first-author)\n  :LAST_AUTHOR: %(aocp--get-last-author)\n  :SOURCE: %(aocp--get-source)\n  :END:\n%?\n+ problem statement ::\n+ solution ::\n+ results ::\n+ limitations ::\n+ remarks ::\n\n  #+begin_src bibtex :tangle yes\n  %c\n  #+end_src\nAssuming you have the above template in paper.txt, you can configure org as follows (replace your-org-inbox-file appropriately):\n(setq org-capture-templates\n    '((\"p\" \"Paper\" entry (file+headline your-org-inbox-file \"Inbox\")\n    \"%[~/.emacs.d/org-templates/paper.txt]\")))\nWith this in place, you can quickly collect all bibliographic information within an org file. Leveraging the powerful functionality provided by org-properties, one can quickly find relevant papers. For instance, I can look up all papers by author X or all papers by author X published at Y.\nA nice little tip is to download a local copy of the pdf and save them all in a folder. To make this easier, aocp.el also pushes the bibkey to the kill-ring. So all that is left to do is click the download button and paste the bibkey as the file name. This ensure 1. That you have all pdfs names consistently and 2. You have a link to the pdf from your org file (see the :PDF: property in the template above) which you can open by hitting C-c C-o over the link. You do not need to poke around in the directory containing the pdfs, all the context is available in the org file and should be the point of entry for all your bibliographic needs!\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nHello everyone and thank you for being here.\nI am Arumoy. I am a PhD Candidate at the Software Engineering Research Group at TU Delft. I have the privilege of working with excellent researchers such as Luis and Arie (who are somewhere in the audience). And after 2 years, I have found my calling.\nIn this talk, I am going to present the current vision I have for my PhD. I hope to generate some interesting discussions and get some feedback along the way.\n\n\nImplicit expectations to explicit tests\nHopefully, I don’t need to convience you that testing is important. We are software engineers, attending a software engineering conference afterall.\nThere is a wonderful paper by Zhang et al. (2020) that summarises the existing literature on ML testing. However, what has been ignored—until now—is the role of visualisations and how we use visual tests in the earlier, more “data-centric” stages of the ML lifecycle.\n\nZhang, Jie M, Mark Harman, Lei Ma, and Yang Liu. 2020. “Machine Learning Testing: Survey, Landscapes and Horizons.” IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.\nVisualisations enable a rapid, exploratory form of analysis. Practitioners use “visual tests” to check for data properties. These visualisations tell a story. They are there for a reason. The expertise and domain knowledge is embedded within the visualisation.\nThis works really well when we are working on our laptop, on say an assignment. But visualisations do not scale well across organisation changes or when we want to move towards a large-scale production system. Visual tests tend to be left behind as latent expectations, rather than explicit failing tests. This research gap between moving from visual to analytical tests is where we wish to contribute.\nVisualisations become latent expectations rather than explicit tests. And this gap between going from latent visualisations to more analytical tests is exactly the research gap where we wish to contribute.\n\n\nThe hunt for data properties\nThe good news is that we have a rich source of data—jupyter notebooks. We are using a two-pronged approach. The first step—which I have been working on for the past month—is to collect these visualisations or data properties manually. We are exploring two sources of data, namely github and kaggle.\nOnce we have found a sufficient quantity of data properties, we will scale it to a larger subset. We are aware of two such datasets proposed by Quaranta, Calefato, and Lanubile (2021) and Pimentel et al. (2019) which contains notebooks from Kaggle and Github respectively.\n\nQuaranta, Luigi, Fabio Calefato, and Filippo Lanubile. 2021. “KGTorrent: A Dataset of Python Jupyter Notebooks from Kaggle.” In 2021 IEEE/ACM 18th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), 550–54. IEEE.\n\nPimentel, João Felipe, Leonardo Murta, Vanessa Braganholo, and Juliana Freire. 2019. “A Large-Scale Study about Quality and Reproducibility of Jupyter Notebooks.” In 2019 IEEE/ACM 16th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), 507–17. IEEE.\n\n\nNext steps and beyond\nOur immediate objective is to provide a format definition of “visual tests” along with examples of alternative analytical tests that can be used by the practitioners.\nOur ultimate research goal is to recommend such analytical tests automatically to the practitioner. Here it becomes a mining challenge which jupyter notebooks contain three sources of information: text, code and images.\nWe see several opportunities to collaborate with researchers working in other areas. Besides ML testing, I see implications in reproducibity and code quality of jupyter notebooks, explainable AI and HCI.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "I am a researcher at TU Delft, working towards my doctorate as part of the Software Engineering Research Group. My research interests lie at the intersection of Data Science, Software Engineering and Design. Here I am developing tools, techniques and best practises which allow us to build, test, deploy, scale and maintain modern software systems with Machine Learning (ML) components. While we must look to the micro to identify and understand a problem, I try to keep an eye towards the current era of big-data and large-scale ML as a long-term area of research. You can find a list of my publications here.\nI completed my Msc. in Computer Science from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Universiteit van Amsterdam in the Netherlands, specializing in Big Data Engineering. As part of my thesis, I conducted interdisciplinary research with Nikhef and The Netherlands eScience Center to improve the data processing pipeline of the KM3NeT Neutrino Telescope using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks.\nI obtained my Bachelor’s in The Applied Sciences from the University of Waterloo in Canada, specializing in System Design Engineering with an option in Entrepreneurship. Here, I learned to bring creative solutions to complex problems with multiple facets such as society, economics, environment and politics. I also learned how to nurture an idea at it’s inception, develop it using systems theory and successfully bring it to the market as a finished product.\nMy professional experience is two pronged. I have over 5 years of software development experience through professional web development positions at and small companies. I am also versed with driven, research oriented projects rooted in diverse topics such as Large Scale Data Engineering, Data Visualization and Artificial Intelligence.\nI enjoy sharing knowledge and having discussions and am always happy to engage with other publicly. Sometimes, I write about my day-to-day challenges as a software engineering, data scientist & researcher.\nAll materials (excluding links to external websites or third party products) on this website are open sourced under the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 3.0 license.\n\n\n Back to top"
