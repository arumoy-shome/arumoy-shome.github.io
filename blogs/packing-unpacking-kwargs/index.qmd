In python, we can unpack keyword arguments using the `**kwargs` in the function definition like so.

```{python}
def greet(**kwargs):
    for _, v in kwargs.items():
        print("Hello {}!".format(v))

greet(a="Aru", b="Ura")
```

Turns out, that we can convert the unpacked dict into back into keyword arguments and pass it along to another function as well! This is done like so.

```{python}
def greet(**kwargs):
    for _, v in kwargs.items():
        print("Hello {}!".format(v))

    meet(**kwargs)

def meet(a=None, b=None):
    print("Nice to meet you again, {} & {}".format(a, b))

greet(a="Aru", b="Ura")
```
