I think every project has 3 distinct components.

1. **Knowledge**. Which may include notes, wikis, task lists, meeting
notes, reviews, planning, etc.
2. **Product**. Which for me tends to be software, data,
visualizations, etc.
3. **Publish**. Which for research can be a paper or for product
driven projects can be blog posts, company announcements, etc.

There are several tools for project management. The one that worked
best for me was [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) and I have stolen
many of their philosophies to craft my own.

The principles of managing a project is fairly simple. First, identify
*who* are involved in the project, *what* you are going to do, *how*
you are going to do it and by *when* you are going to do it.

# The Who
The who become the stakeholders or clients of the project and need to
be kept up to date on the progress, potential problems, approached for
input, etc. Effective and clear communication is of utmost importance
here.

# The What
The what is the goal of the project. Some of the questions that we may
ask are: What are we trying to solve? What is our research question?
What are we building? etc.

# The How
The how is the task list. Try to visualise the entire lifecycle of the
project (to the best of your abilities given your current knowledge
and technical capabilities) and write down the distinct phases of the
project. Next, for each phase write down a list of tasks (and sub
tasks). Keep a fluid mindset, projects change, clients want different
things, research is dynamic. The idea is to start with a set of tasks
and revise as and when necessary.

# The When
The when is the date of completion. Deadlines are important for proper
goal and expectation setting. It's important to have a final deadline
for the entire project, but also to have intermediate deadlines for
smaller batches/mini-projects. Divide and conquer is the name of the
game here.

Some recommend a few weeks (4-6) for these batches/mini-projects. For
research, I have found that taking things at a week-by-week basis
works best and is the most flexible method of working given how
dynamic research can be.

For each of these batches, I like to have a single focus of work. I
then extract the relevant tasks that I should get done in order to
accomplish the focus.

Determining focus is subjective and external factors such as other
engagements play a role. The goal is to always plan sufficient work so
as to not under deliver. I actively try not to plan too many things so
as to feel overwhelmed or anxious.

At the end of each batch/cycle/week I conduct a review. I think about
what went well (so things I was able to finish), what did not go well
(problems, challenges, etc.) and what can be improved (mostly for
personal reflection). During the review I triage the task list, revise
project scope, deliverables, etc.
