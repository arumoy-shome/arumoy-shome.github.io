# Professional Experience

**PhD Candidate | Data Science**, [Delft University of
Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), **Delft, Netherlands**, *2021-2025*

+ Developed large-scale data mining pipeline to process 297,800 Jupyter
  notebooks (283 GB) from GitHub and Kaggle. Extracted 3 million code
  statements using Python, Pandas, and Bash. Released results as an open-source
  dataset to enable future research. Project website:
  <https://github.com/arumoy-shome/shome2023notebook>
+ Proposed data-centric fairness testing methodology for machine learning
  models. Evaluated 4 ML algorithms against 2 fairness metrics across
  5 datasets with 1,600 end-to-end ML pipeline executions using Python and
  Scikit-Learn. Project website:
  <https://github.com/arumoy-shome/shome2022qualitative>
+ Pioneered "data smells" framework for ML dataset quality assessment. Analyzed
  top 25 ML datasets from Kaggle using Python and Pandas. Identified 14 data
  quality antipatterns and published the findings as an open-source catalog.
  Project website: <https://arumoy.me/data-smells>
+ Executed the data and ML pipelines on a Linux server and distributed the
  workloads across 20 CPU cores using Bash and Unix commands. Used Git and
  Docker to provide reproducible software artifacts.
+ Managed 2 M.Sc. research projects, and an edX MOOC course on Unix
  tools with 1000+ active students.
+ Delivered technical talks, poster presentations and guest lectures to
  academic and industry audiences. Translated technical concepts into
  actionable insights for diverse stakeholders.

**Research Intern | Data Science**, [Netherlands eScience
Centre](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/), **Amsterdam, Netherlands**,
*2019-2020*

+ Built ML pipeline for neutrino detection in the KM3NeT Neutrino Telescope,
  implementing Multi Layer Perceptrons and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks
  to process high-volume particle physics data. Project website:
  <https://github.com/arumoy-shome/km3net>
+ Delivered solution that outperformed existing GPU-based systems in filtration
  quality while meeting strict performance requirements for real-time particle
  detection.
+ Collaborated across interdisciplinary teams including particle physicists,
  GPU engineers, and computer scientists, translating complex AI requirements
  into practical implementations.

**Web Developer Intern | Software Engineering**,
[Shopify](https://shopify.com), **Ottawa, Canada**,
*2015-2016*

+ Collaborated with developers, designers and product managers to implement
  UI/UX features such as web components, animations and styling on a mature
  Ruby on Rails project using Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, \& SCSS.
+ Applied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and Test-Driven
  Development (TDD) to refactor code and improve test coverage.
+ Used Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to optimize database queries and reduce
  server response time.

# Technical Projects

**3D Kadaster**, University of Amsterdam, *2018*

+ Developed 3D model of all buildings in The Netherlands using AHN2 point cloud
  dataset (1.6 TB) and BAG building polygons dataset (177 GB).
+ Processed massive geospatial datasets using PySpark distributed computing
  framework for scalable data processing.
+ Executed algorithms on SurfSara supercomputer infrastructure for
  high-performance geospatial analysis.
+ Created interactive 3D visualizations using Three.js for web-based
  exploration of national building infrastructure.

**ACE: Art, Color and Emotions**, ACM International Conference on MultiMedia, *2019*

+ Built ACE, a visual sentiment analysis platform by developing custom ML
  models trained on the large-scale OmniArt dataset (512 GB) to enable
  data-driven analysis of artistic emotions. Demo video:
  <https://youtu.be/B1ZM6EQgEvU>
+ Designed and implemented full-stack solution featuring intuitive D3.js
  interface with optimized interaction patterns and scalable web architecture
  capable of handling high-volume image processing and real-time sentiment
  analysis.

**Elevate**, University of Waterloo, *2017*

+ Developed an improved and cost-effective alternative to state-of-the-art
  cognitive assessment tools for Down Syndrome using web technologies, adaptive
  learning, and human-centric design. Project website:
  <https://arumoy.me/elevate>
+ Established international research partnership with Waterloo Regional Down
  Syndrome Society (Canada) and Fundacion Paraiso Down (El Salvador) to explore
  specialized educational resource needs through comprehensive user surveys and
  interviews.
+ Implemented iterative design methodology with usability testing, user
  testing, and engagement testing as primary validation protocols.
+ Developed comprehensive business plan and presented product at multiple
  startup incubators and pitch competitions to obtain funding.

# Professional Activities

+ Collaborated as committee member for International
  Conference on AI Engineering (CAIN) '25.
  Demonstrated teamwork, communication, and project
  management skills to coordinate logistics and enhance
  engagement for 125 participants.
+ Served as program committee member for DeepTest '25 and NL-based Software
  Engineering (NLBSE) '24 international workshops. Critically evaluated and
  provided constructive feedback on 4 technical research papers.
