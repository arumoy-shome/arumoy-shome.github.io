    In collaboration with [RTL](https://www.rtl.nl/) and [ICT with
    Industry](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/ictwi2023), we developed a
    prototype to automatically generate a trailer for a given episode of
    *Goede Tijd, Slechte Tijd*, a popular Dutch TV Show.

    Unfortunately, the project is not open source.
