    Lightening talk at [SEN Symposium
    2023](https://www.sen-symposium.nl/). Presented my research
    direction, work done so far, challenges and next steps. Content
    was mostly similar to the talk below.

- title: "Towards Understanding Machine Learning Testing in Practice"
  date: 2023-05-15
  abstract: |
    Presentation for our poster titled *Towards Understanding Machine
    Learning Testing in Practice* which was published in [CAIN
    2023](https://conf.researchr.org/home/cain-2023).

- title: "Data Validation with TFDV"
  date: 2022-05-16
  abstract: |
    In this lecture we will go over the basics of data validation. The
    first half of this lecture will be a talk on the fundamentals of
    data validation. We will answer *what is data validation?*, *why
    should we validate our data?* and *how we can validate our data?*.
    The second half of the lecture will be a hands-on tutorial on
    using [Tensorflow Data
    Validation](https://github.com/tensorflow/data-validation),
    instructions & code for which can be found on [this github
    repo](https://github.com/arumoy-shome/remla).

- title: "Data Smells in Public Datasets"
  date: 2022-05-04
  abstract: |
    In this talk I will present our recent paper titled *Data Smells
    in Public Datasets* which was published at the *[1^st^
    International Conference on AI Engineering (CAIN)
    2022](https://conf.researchr.org/home/cain-2022)*. I will first
    present the problem we are trying to solve along with the
    contributions that we made. I will present the methodology which
    was followed along with the results obtained. I will present a
    select few smells which I personally find interesting & hope will
    generate some discussion. Finally, we will conclude the talk with
    some high level takeaways from our study along with the
    limitations & future directions of work.

    A talk on Privacy Preserving Deep Learning (PPDL) I gave to my
    research group. It was largly based on a literature review I did during my Msc.

- title: "Research Workflow in Plaintext"
  date: 2021-07-12
  abstract: |
    In this talk I will go over how we can use Emacs and org-mode to
    craft a research workflow. We will look at how we can leverage the
    power of Emacs and org-mode to capture, store, search and retrieve
    research data, all in plain text! The talk will touch upon how
    org-mode can be used as an environment for literate programming
    and reproducible research. I do not assume any prior knowledge of
    emacs or org-mode and I want this to be more of a discussion
    rather than a talk. Please ask me questions as I go along and
    share your thoughts, tips and techniques with others!
